# Dynon Skyview CSV to GPX converter

Dynon Skyview has a feature to export flight log data (the "black box") to a CSV file.

This script converts the CSV into a GPX GPS trace that can be used with most GIS and map tools.

Handy to debrief your flights.

Note: the CSV has many other useful fields (attitude, engine data, flaps position, etc) that could be used easily.
